# Surf_up

## Overview and Analysis 
After I found or newest passion on our holidays on Hawaii, my newest dream is to live, for good, in Hawaii, so i can enjoy the surfing life with a perfect weather. But, how may I accomplish that? I got an idea of developing a surf & ice cream shop, so I can live from that in Hawaii. I have some savings, but I need investors, and I know the perfect person who can help me with this, but his main concern is how profitable the store will be due to the weather. I have to develop an analysis for him for the June and December temperatures, to visualize if the business is sustainable during all the year.

## Results
We are going to present the results, and reference some of the principal differences that we got from the analysis:

December tempeture information

1. There is just a difference of 2° in the maximum tempeture on June and December, so December does have similar tempetures as June. 
2. Otherwise, in the minimum tempetures, there is a difference of 8° degrees, so it means that December has lower tempetures than June.
3. In the mean, we can visualize that there is a difference of 3.9°, which means that in average December is colder than June, but not with a big difference. 

## Summary
Visualizing the tempetures of both months, I come to the conclussion that the business is probable to success, because there are no exreme tempetures in December, and there is not a BIG difference between the statistics of June and December. 

I would get two extra queries in order to have more information about the weather: 
1. I would get the precipitation of the previous year, to see how many days rains in the location. 
2. Also I will explore the months were is most common to rain and be cold, in order to take some days off of work.
